## Background

Purpose of project is to extract insights from survey data where data exists is a columnar format

Survey asks respondents about how to improve by identifying both positive and negative trends

Assumption - respondents state what they would like to see more of and what they want to see less of

Respondents want to see an increased trend of positives and a decreasing trend of negatives

- It is assumed that respondents will use certain phrases to identify these desires for trends
