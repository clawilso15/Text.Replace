- Accuracy
  - Are the results accurate?
    # If the results are just to create a corpus and dfm from .csv data then the 
      package appears to work just fine, given the correct inputs. However, it is unclear from
      the documentation how the input data should be formatted.
  - Is it clear how the results were computed?
    # Yes, the results are computed by running similar {quanteda} commands.

- Compilation
  - Did the analytic work? (i.e. install correctly, startup correctly)
    # The package installed correctly from GitHub and started up without any issues.
      The sample commands do not work unless the entire repo is forked because the 
      sample data files do not lie in a data directory reachable from within the 
      package. I would recommend using the usethis() command to enter the sample data
      into the backend that is available when the app loads.
  - Were errors encountered when executing code according to the documentation?
    # devtools::test() had one test failure for the createCorpus command could not
      find function "find root". This is most likely because the function is an 
      {rprojroot} function and {rprojroot} is not properly loaded into the environment.
      On that note, not all users of the package will be working within a project, so 
      using this type of absolute file pathing will inevitably cause issues. It is 
      better to store all the required files and data in a package specific location
      that is declared in the namespace.

- Ease of use
  - Is it clear how to use the analytic? (i.e. is the documentation clear)
    # After creating a project on my local machine and pulling in the repo, I was able
      to run the sample scripts. It seems like create_corpus() is doing little more than
      quanteda::corpus(). The function worked but I the benefit of it isn't clearly 
      explained. There is little documentation to support when or why a user would use
      this package. I'm afraid that create_dfm() suffers from the same short comings.
  - Are the visualizations/plots interpretable?
    # The outputs are a corpus and a document frequency matrix. The package requires
      the user to use other packages for text analysis and visualization.

# Assessment #
##############

Based on the rubric below, I have to assess this package as Satisfactory for the following
reasons:
 - The proposed text analytic tasks were left incomplete
 - The documentation did not give a user a clear idea of how to implement the package
 - The provided sample report required data not available by simply installing the package
